1. WriteBatch or Transaction
2. Why there is no protection for writes to column families that don't exist

RocksDB has something called "Wide columns"; technically it looks like rows,
but I didn't see any iterator API for it (maybe I just didn't look hard enough).
Nonetheless, I think it will be easier to just simulate rows by keys:
(row, key) -> (value, timestamp) will be stored in RocksDB
as "row:key" -> (value, timestamp). Keys are sorted, so iterating
should work nicely.
