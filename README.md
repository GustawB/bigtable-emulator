# Google Cloud Platform C++ Client Libraries

<!-- This file is automatically generated by ci/test-markdown/generate-readme.sh -->

> **NOTICE:** This repo will soon contain the code for all the other related
`google-cloud-cpp-*` repos. As a new monorepo
([#3612](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/issues/3612)), the
versioning of this repo will be changing to have a single per-repo version. See
https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp/issues/3615 for more info.

This repository contains client libraries for the following services, unless
noted in their **README.md** files these are all
[Generally Available](#Versioning):

- [Google Cloud Storage](google/cloud/storage/README.md)
- [Google Cloud Bigtable](google/cloud/bigtable/README.md)

These links contain information about:

* Where to find the documentation for the library and the service.
* How to get started using the library.
* How to incorporate the library into your build system.

The [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file documents how to install the library in your
workstation.

## Versioning

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

**GA**: Libraries defined at a GA quality level are expected to be stable and
any backwards-incompatible changes will be noted in the documentation. Major
changes to the API will signaled by changing major version number
(e.g. 1.x.y -> 2.0.0).

**Beta**: Libraries defined at a Beta quality level are expected to be mostly
stable and we're working towards their release candidate. We will address issues
and requests with a higher priority.

**Alpha**: Libraries defined at an Alpha quality level are still a
work-in-progress and are more likely to get backwards-incompatible updates.
Additionally, it's possible for Alpha libraries to get deprecated and deleted
before ever being promoted to Beta or GA.
